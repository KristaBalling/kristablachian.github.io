        <p id="about_p">Hi! I'm Krista. I am a Full-Stack Web Developer from Charlotte, North Carolina. 
            I studied web development at The Iron Yard and graduated in 2017 with a specialization in 
            Java and Back-End Engineering. I began coding as a creative outlet as a stay-at-home mom. 
            I dabbled in JavaScript, Ruby and Java for the love of creative problem solving before deciding 
            that it was the right career path for me. Through my code school experience, I discovered 
            my talent for back-end engineering and SQL databases. When I'm not practicing my coding skills,
           I can usually be found running 10Ks around Charlotte parks with my two little boys (on a bike and in 
           a stroller), playing my violin or doing escape rooms with friends. </p>

            <p class= "project_p">This was a collaborative project I built with a team of four full-stack students after graduating from TIY.
                Together we designed and created an app that allows people to search for food trucks in Charlotte, NC using an interactive google 
                map. Users are able to search for a specific food type, their favorite truck or simply see what's around them using their current 
                location. The food truck owners have the ability to click a button that automatically updates their current location 
                if they have moved. I created and managed the databases to hold all user and food truck info for the sign-up and location services.<a href="https://github.com/cjzeledon/FoodTruckFinder"> View Code</a></p>

            <p class="project_p">This was my final project for the Java specialization 
                portion of my time at TIY. Written in Java with a Spring framework, this
                app keeps track of a parking garage companyâ€™s list of paid parking lots, 
                displays open versus occupied spots and keeps a database of all transactions
                with their corresponding spot IDs. Technologies used: *Java *Spring *Maven *Heroku

            <p>This CRUD app is from the Back-End Fundamentals part of the course.
                It is modeled in the likeness of Stack Overflow which allows users 
                to create an account, login as a user, then post, display, edit, 
                and delete snippets of code. Written in JavaScript using MongoDB 
                and Sequelize.
