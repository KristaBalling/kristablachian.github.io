        <p id="about_p">Hi! I'm Krista. I am a Full-Stack Web Developer from Charlotte, North Carolina. 
            I studied web development at The Iron Yard and graduated in 2017 with a specialization in 
            Java and Back-End Engineering. I began coding as a creative outlet as a stay-at-home mom. 
            I dabbled in JavaScript, Ruby and Java for the love of creative problem solving before deciding 
            that it was the right career path for me. Through my code school experience, I discovered 
            my talent for back-end engineering and SQL databases. When I'm not practicing my coding skills,
           I can usually be found running 10Ks around Charlotte parks with my two little boys (on a bike and in 
           a stroller), playing my violin or doing escape rooms with friends. </p>

            <p>Final project done with a team after graduation. With two front-end teammates and one back-end partner, we created an app that allows people to search for food trucks in Charlotte using a google map. The food truck owner can click a button to update their location as shown to the user.</p>
